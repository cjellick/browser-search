Description: Uses the browser to search Google and return and list of search results.
Tools: github.com/gptscript-ai/browser
Args: query: the thing to search for
Args: number: the number of search results to return

Do not make parallel tool calls. Wait for the previous call to finish before you start a new one.

Browse https://google.com/search?q=$query. Scroll to the bottom to load more results. Then get the page contents.
Find all of the search results on the page. Deduplicate the results. Return them in a JSON format like this:

{
    "results": [
        {
            "url": "page link",
            "title": "page title",
            "description": "page description"
        },
        {
            "url": "page link",
            "title", "page title",
            "description", "page description"
        }
    ]
}

Return five search results by default. If the $number arg is set, return that many search results instead.
